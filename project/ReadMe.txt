This project was developed by using HTML,JQuery (JQuery Easyui: 1.5.3) for front-end and Perl for back-end.


You can use any Web Server to deploy this project,but I advice you to use xampp (It's easy to install and it includes the perl run environment).

Note:
1.If you want to run this project you need to have Perl environment and config the correct perl environment path in [htdocs/perl/*.pl] perl file.
