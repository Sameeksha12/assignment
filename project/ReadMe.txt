This project was developed using HTML5, CSS3 and 
JQuery(JQuery Easyui: 1.5.3) for front end and Perl for backend.


Any Web Server can be used to deploy this project,but I have used xampp,because this is easy to install, includes the perl runtime 
environment and its free.

Note:
1. To run this project you need to have perl environment and config the correct perl environment path in [htdocs/perl/*.pl] perl file.
