This project was developed using HTML5,JQuery(Easyui: 1.5.3),CSS for front-end and Perl for back-end and SQLite for db.


You can use any Web Server to deploy this project,but I used xampp,because this is easy to install, it includes the perl run environment and its free.

Note:
1.If you want to run this project you need to have perl environment and config the correct perl environment path in [htdocs/perl/*.pl] perl file.
